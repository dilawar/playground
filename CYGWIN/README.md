Compile with gcc.exe and mingw-???-gcc.exe. Copy the generated binaries to 
C:\ or some other place and run them using cmd.exe

The binary generated using gcc.exe does not run unless -static is passed and 
cygwin1.dll is copied to the same directory.

The binary generated by mingw-gcc.exe runs without -static. It also requires
cygwin1.dll

# TLDR

Use mingw-gcc to port application to Windows. It generates smaller binaries
since gcc related libraries need not to be linked using `-static`.
