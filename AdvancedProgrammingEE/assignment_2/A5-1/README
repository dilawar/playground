========================================

Here how it goes,

STEP 1 :
	make all

STEP 2 :
	./lfsr --key "10101010100100101010101001001011001000101"
			or
	./lfsr --key "1010101011"

After --key (i.e. 64 bit secret key) you need to specify the value in binary.
You can leave some of the digit unspecified. It'll take them as 0.

Use " " to give key value. Its like string.

Public key is specified within code. You have no control over it.

It will ask you for register polynomials and its clock it. This process can be
lengthy. My apologies!
